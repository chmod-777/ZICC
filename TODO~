* what to do about header image on all pages besides home page? Just chuck it? The one with Great Zimbabwe & the Taj Mahal...and some fine daij ;)


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New note to Mr Tambo:
*********************

1. Actually, I wanted the page-wrapper to be centered vs occupying the whole page, just like the original, hence setting a fixed width in px, though that did break the resposiveness, we need a solution that retains responsiveness but also centeres the page wrapper

2. The outside edges of the service items should be aligned with the main image such that they line up and not overflow as is the case now.

3. In mobile view everything is great except that the main header image isn't showing up. I think that one is essential from a design perspective considering that the space it would have occupied is still there so it looks odd. I think we could have a different image for mobile view where the text is erased and maybe placed in a div right below the image before the service items. I thought you were reffering to the round logo image at the top when you said on app that we should remove it.

4. Navbar highlights are great, however, if you look closely, there is a tiny bit of space at the bottom that remains grey, we need to fix this. Also, we need ideas on what to do with styling the active navbar item. In the original site, they were colored Indian Orange as well which looked weird when you highlighted a nav item right next to the active one. I'm thinking we can keep the darker shade of grey but make the text light up in Indian Orange instead of white as is the case now.

5.On the footer, the grey background is now there, though it becomes larger at the bottom in the area with the black list items. You may need to tilt your screen to notice this because it's very subtle and most laptops have poor viewing angles. This problem only shows up on larger screens though. However, I like how the link items are adapting to different screen sizes, it's just the grey background that's off, otherwise the footer is done.

6. Service Item - Areas of opportunity should be aligned left, I think we also should put the bullets, I dunno looks better in my opinion that way. What do you think?

z. I am using Firefox 34.0, we should keep in mind browser differences. Which one are you using?

My Response
***********

Alrighty, wifi back and I've had a look at the stie over the past few hours.

1. Setting margins in the body is what makes everything skwank. The page-wrapper should be centered as is, the reason for that little space to the right is usually a div with an abnormal width (so for example with the services items, the middle one had a really wide div, hence the rewrite to make it smaller). Still haven't figured out which div is causing the little bit of extra space left.

2. Aligned the service items using percentage based left/right padding to keep it responsive.

3. Ah, now the problem with this image is the text, because when the image resizes so does the text, which makes it impossible to read on a small screen, but you can still see there's something there, so the best might be to edit an image without the text on it, then place the text on the page as a div whose position is relative to the image to appear as it does right now, but then we can get rid of the div when the writting gets too small.

4. Removed the space by setting a negative margin in #navbar css. Made the active item to make it more distinct.

5. Ah, I forgot I'd have to change the html on each page, too used to working with base templates. The footer looks okay on the index2 page, and I changed the contact2 page to have the same footer. I'm guessing the contact2 page is the one that had the wonk footer?

6. Aligned them left (which by convention is the the way to do it) and threw in some bullets. Also threw in some media queries to make the service item sections have matching heights on larger screens.

7. There was also that little isue with the tumbnails, used a media query to set the max width on smaller screens to 40% and margins to auto so that they are horizontally centered.
